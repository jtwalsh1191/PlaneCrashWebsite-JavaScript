# PlaneCrashWebsite-JavaScript

This is a website created from scratch by me and a partner to show a database of plane crashes. It has many functionalities like sorting through, showing youtube
videos, filtering through the database, and so much more. This website uses HTML and css to make the website visually pleasing.
